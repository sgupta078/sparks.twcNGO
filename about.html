          Together.We.Can is an NGO based in Nalanda and is formed by
          individuals who are committed to protecting the environment. Our NGO
          aims of increasing tree plantation in the state of Bihar. We have
          aimed to plant and grow up to 5 crore trees across Bihar. We provide
          free spalings in school, colleges and universities and let the
          students plant and take care of those saplings. Also, we regularly
          check up to see how the trees are and surprisingly have a 95 percent
          survival rate so far. Taking it ahead, we are now planning to expand
          our operations to almost all educationl institution across India.

          partnership with authorities across India with more than 20 feedings
          programs. We have a team of well-trained in-house cooks who follow
          strict hygiene and quality parameters. Our nutritional meals and
          energy snacks like biscuits, bread, rice, vegetables and mineral water
          are distributed to the needy with the help of government authorities.
